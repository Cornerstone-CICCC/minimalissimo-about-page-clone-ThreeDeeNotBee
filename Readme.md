# Flexbox-&-Grid-Assignment

Your task is to replicate the [Minimalissimo/about](https://minimalissimo.com/suggest) site (using `FLEXBOX`, `GRID` and `responsive design`).

## What to build

- **Goal:** Replicate **the ABOUT page only** (the Minimalissimo/about page is shown in the screenshot).
- **Scope:** You do **NOT** need to clone or replicate other pages from [Minimalissimo](https://minimalissimo.com/).
- **The screenshot below was taken from the Minimalissimo page for your reference.**

You are not provided with any `index.html` or `styles.css` file, so you have to create and link them.

> Make sure to use a `npm` project <br>
> Structure the project properly <br>
> Use semantic HTML

## Expectations

- Use **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** where appropriate.
- Make the page **responsive** (works on mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Add **basic hover animations** as per the target website(examples: link hover, button hover, subtle card hover, underline effects etc).
- **Grading note:** The closer your result matches the target page (layout, spacing, typography feel, alignment, sizing, responsiveness, hover effects etc), the higher your grade.

## Instructions

0. **Inspect the target website and understand the layout, spacing, typography, colors, and other design elements.**

1. **Create the HTML and CSS Files**
   - Create an `index.html` file.
   - Create a `styles.css` file.
   - Link the `styles.css` file to the `index.html`.

2. **Use Flexbox and Grid**
   - Utilize Flexbox and Grid layout techniques to replicate the layout in the screenshot.

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Use media queries and flexible units (%, rem, fr, minmax, etc.) so the layout adapts cleanly across screen sizes.

4. **Hover animations**
   - Add appropriate animations & transitions (no JavaScript required).

## Submission Requirements

- **Push your final code to the `main` branch of this repo.**
- **Deploy your site** using **Netlify** or **Vercel**.
  - Note: Since this repo is under the **CICCC organization**, Netlify or Vercel may not allow CI/CD directly from GitHub.
  - If CI/CD does not work, deploy by **drag-and-drop** (Netlify) or **manual upload** of the project folder (depending on the platform).

## Deliverables

1. Push your final code to the `main` branch of this repo.
2. Add deployed link in this `README.md` file (Netlify or Vercel)
